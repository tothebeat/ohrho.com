Their office is pretty neat, there was free pizza and beer, there were interesting people to talk to, but what I liked best was perusing their books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my life, I've gravitated to the bookshelves in a room to run my eyes across the book spines in hopes of finding something interesting. While I worked at &lt;a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/"&gt;Kellogg&lt;/a&gt;, I loved working on the PCs of certain professors because I knew they had interesting books on their bookshelves. In the 11 years I worked there, I spent thousands of hours working in other people's offices, fixing their computers, and in every lull or progress bar I would take a glance at those fascinating spines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a picture of SpartzInc's bookcase, so I would be able to look at the spines more later. Do other people do this?&lt;/p&gt;
