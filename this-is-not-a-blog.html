</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Blogging is hard. Writing well for an audience, making it worth their time to read, is no small task. While I appreciate good writing, this is not my platform for demonstrating my own skills to you. This is not my soap box. I have no interest in convincing you of anything. I don't even really care about expressing my views, because I feel that means I want someone to listen (I don't). Except for my relationships with a very select few people, I know that my opinion has little to no effect on anyone, so I just don't bother wasting the breath.</p>
<p>When I write content for this place, such as this article right here, I remind myself that I need not choose something to write about that I think will be interesting to other people. Oh, you do think this is interesting? Well, bloody jolly good! But I don't really care. You think this is boring? Then why are you even reading this? Yes, I will insult my potential reader because I only expect myself to ever read this. Yes, I insult myself constantly.</p>
<p>The linear structure of blogs is overly simplistic to me. Perhaps that comes with the meaning of "log". I want this to serve as a growing collection of my thoughts over time, growing both in content as well as structural complexity. I have not seen tags used to organize content in any way that I find satisfying. For the past several years, I have been driven to get better at programming in large part because I want to make that a reality.</p>
<p>This is not a soap box. This is just the next step with creative, free-form tools from pen and paper.</p>
