Summary: How I want to organize this site, and it has little do with with blogging.

Blogging is hard. Writing well for an audience, making it worth their time to read, is no small task. While I appreciate good writing, this is not my platform for demonstrating my own skills to you. This is not my soap box. I have no interest in convincing you of anything. I don't even really care about expressing my views, because I feel that means I want someone to listen (I don't). Except for my relationships with a very select few people, I know that my opinion has little to no effect on anyone, so I just don't bother wasting the breath.

When I write content for this place, such as this article right here, I remind myself that I need not choose something to write about that I think will be interesting to other people. Oh, you do think this is interesting? Well, bloody jolly good! But I don't really care. You think this is boring? Then why are you even reading this? Yes, I will insult my potential reader because I only expect myself to ever read this. Yes, I insult myself constantly.

The linear structure of blogs is overly simplistic to me. Perhaps that comes with the meaning of "log". I want this to serve as a growing collection of my thoughts over time, growing both in content as well as structural complexity. I have not seen tags used to organize content in any way that I find satisfying. For the past several years, I have been driven to get better at programming in large part because I want to make that a reality.

This is not a soap box. This is just the next step with creative, free-form tools from pen and paper.
