Summary: A major highlight of the November 2013 ChiPy meeting was browsing SpartzInc's books.

Yesterday I went to the ChiPy November meeting, which was held at the [Spartz](http://www.spartzinc.com/) offices. Their office is pretty neat, there was free pizza and beer, there were interesting people to talk to, but what I liked best was perusing their books.

All my life, I've gravitated to the bookshelves in a room to run my eyes across the book spines in hopes of finding something interesting. While I worked at [Kellogg](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/), I loved working on the PCs of certain professors because I knew they had interesting books on their bookshelves. In the 11 years I worked there, I spent thousands of hours working in other people's offices, fixing their computers, and in every lull or progress bar I would take a glance at those fascinating spines.

I took a picture of SpartzInc's bookcase, so I would be able to look at the spines more later. Do other people do this?
