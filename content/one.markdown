Summary: Tonight's reflections on why I am seeking challenges I recently avoided.

This is truly a challenge. I must be a masochist. I've set up this blog tonight 
on my domain [http://ohroh.com](http://ohroh.com) using my [webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com) 
account, using the static blog generator [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/) 
in a [Python](http://docs.python.org/2/) [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). 
I'm editing this page in the text editor vim, connected to my webfaction account over SSH. 
No GUI here, which is startling for me since I really like clicking things with a mouse. 
I do this kind of stuff all day at work, and I've been programming for many years, and 
still this feels completely foreign to me. 

I guess that gets to the heart of the matter; it should feel foreign, because I really
haven't done anything this challenging before. I really find working in the command-line
interface of Linux to be challenging, especially using the keybindings of vim without
the arrow keys, but I have shown myself it is possible for me to learn new things. I 
now use the letters 'hjkl' for left/down/up/right. A year ago, asking me to do that while
doing something else I've never done before would be like asking me to ride a bicycle
on the ceiling.

I feel very uncomfortable doing these things I'm not familiar with, doing things I feel
I'm not good at (yet), especially when doing them in public or for pay. And yet I persist,
doing these things both for pay and ostensibly in public (this, [github](https://github.com/tothebeat))
because I know that life is too short to stick with what's easiest and most comfortable.
