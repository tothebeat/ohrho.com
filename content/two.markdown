Summary: A growing list of my favorite modules/libraries for Python.

* [requests](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/) - Working with HTTP requests in a way that doesn't make me want to shove a stick in my eye.
* [pillow](http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - I liked PIL, the Python Imaging Library, but I guess that wasn't good enough for some folks and so they made it better. I like the name too. 
* [unicodecsv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodecsv/0.9.0) - Try working with international character sets in any kind of tabular data, that you need to work with in Python. You'll need this. And a machete.
* [beautifulsoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - An awesome html parsing module, that can use either [lxml](http://lxml.de/) or [html5lib](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python) for its engine. 
* [__future__](http://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html) - Just for `unicode_literals`. It has a lot of imports that help prepare for Python 3, but this single import makes working with unicode strings so much less painful. No need to remember to tack on a 'u' before every string.  
* [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Hey, I have to like this because it's my job. It's pretty nice, don't get me wrong.
* [re](http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) - You can't avoid using this. Like it.
* [collections](http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict) - Just for `defaultdict`. `d = defaultdict(lambda: [])` is just beautiful. 
* [ipython](http://ipython.org/) - Nothing beats this shell.
* [selenium](http://www.realpython.com/blog/python/headless-selenium-testing-with-python-and-phantomjs/#.UoRfeh8TDZg) - This makes scraping easy.
* [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - I've barely scratched the surface with this, or even used it properly, but it has helped me vastly reduce the complexity of using a SQL database in the past.
* [xlrd/xlwt](http://www.python-excel.org/) - Two modules for reading and writing Excel files, respectively. These can handle '.xls' files from Office 2003 and earlier, along with '.xlsx' files from Office 2007 and newer.
* [pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/) - I have to represent for what created this blog.
